The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) was the most famous and one of the most powerful 
defensive charms known to wizardkind.
 It was an immensely complicated and extremely difficult spell that channelled the caster's positive emotions 
 into a powerful protection. When cast properly, it evoked a partially-tangible positive energy force known as
  a Patronus (pl. Patronuses)[5] or spirit guardian.[3] It was the primary protection against Dementors and 
  Lethifolds, against which there were no other defences.
